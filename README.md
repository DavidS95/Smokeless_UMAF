# Bios Flasher? Where We’re Going, We Don’t Need Bios Flasher?

## What this can do
With this tool you can access and modify AMD PBS/AMD CBS Menu and possibly AMD Overclocking without flashing, and by just booting from a USB drive.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

 **Using this tool you agree also to these rules.**
 **Think twice before committing any change.**
 **These are real bios settings treat them as such.**
 **Not Evey option visable works or should be used.**
 **These are even more true with the BETA version.**

Changing setting could lead to bricking your device, so handle with care. Be sure to have a method to recover your device if things go wrong. For most options a bios clear is suitable, however for some of the more dangerous settings, you might need a proper reflash, which is why they are classed as "dangerous settings".

# Known Problem (Read This)
* Dell user(s) have reported that the normal bios will not load anymore after using this:

    Fix thanks to (BIT_GAM3R and the Gaming [Laptop Mod Discord Comunity](https://discord.gg/FDgUR5cpCg)):
    
    Boot the tool, access the BootManager, delete the Misc Option, this should not be there, it is created by a bug. If you tried accessing the BootManager before...
    A proper fix will be pushed when ready
    
* Doesnt work on the 6000 series (Rembrant) versions of the Onexplayer, AOKZOE, and AYANEO devices

## Dangerous Settings
Known settings that will make you brick your device - Note this primarily refers to the "locked" intergrated laptop / handheld APUs rather than unlocked desktop APUs or CPUs:
* P0State Vid 
* Curve Optimizer for certain APUs commonly unlocked 5000 series - however this can be done through windows using UXTU for all affected models

## How this works
AMD PBS/AMD CBS and possibly AMD Overclocking (Aod_Setup) export their HII database regardless of the manufacturer, so if we can load these we can access these menus without a problem.

This package includes two main components: a loader and the UI component. The latter one are built from a standard edk2 package.
On boot from USB the loader will unregister the existing bios FormBrowser and will load this custom one, proving the new interface for this boot.

The only drawback of this method is that you need to boot from USB to access these menus.

## How to use it
Extract in a FAT32 USB, and boot from it, it will load the custom bios UI. Now if you enter Device Manager, AMD PBS/CBS will be there, you can modify what you want, and when done, just hit esc until it asks you to save.

On AMI bios, in addition to AMD PBS and CBS will be shown also "Setup", this is the regular bios, the edit here might not be saved (AMD PBS/CBS, Aod Setup).

# Notable Options
* Ram Overclocking + Timings - Works on Picasso, Renior "U" and Luccine "U" apus up to 3200mhz, on Renior "H" apus up to 4400mhz, on Steam Deck.

    Might work on some Rembrant models, or CZN HX and HS apus with though the amd overclocking menu however all of these apus might have issues expect failure.
    Disabling gear down mode, power down mode, and setting the command rate seems to work on every apu.

* UMA buffer size - works on all apus. Allows for different "Vram" amounts.

* FCLK Control - Works for Renior H and might work for steam deck, CZN apus, and Rembrant apus.

* AMD Overclocking menu - Most settings that are in here should work if the menu appears for you.
